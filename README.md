# IEAWindSystems GitHub Pages source

This repository contains the source files for the
[IEAWindSystems GitHub Pages](https://ieawindsystems.github.io/) site.
This website is compiled with Jekyll using the 
[daattali/beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) theme.
The docs build happens through the
[jekyll-gh-pages.yml](https://github.com/IEAWindSystems/IEAWindSystems.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml)
workflow.
This was autogenerated by GitHub and it *just works*, so consider any changes carefully.

This site uses the remote-theme option.
Instead of cloning the theme repository, the the configuration has:

```yaml
remote_theme: daattali/beautiful-jekyll
```

Then, GitHub Pages uses this repository as inputs to the theme for building the site.
The theme website has [great documentation](https://beautifuljekyll.com/getstarted/)
for using the theme with the remote option.
The GitHub Pages settings are set to the source being "GitHub Actions".
