# IEA Wind Systems GitHub Organization

The [IEAWindSystems GitHub organization](https://github.com/IEAWindSystems)
manages and coordinates repositories created through the IEA Wind
Technology Collaboration Programme (TCP).
The work included here is typically the result of collaborative research and development
through the following tasks:
- [IEA Wind Task 37](https://iea-wind.org/task37/): Systems Engineering
- [IEA Wind Task 55](https://iea-wind.org/task55/): Reference Wind Turbines and Plants

Projects included in this organization are:
- [windIO](https://github.com/IEAWindSystems/windIO)
- Reference systems:
    - [IEA-15-240-RWT](https://github.com/IEAWindSystems/IEA-15-240-RWT) - 15MW reference wind turbine repository developed in conjunction with IEA Wind
    - [IEA-22-280-RWT](https://github.com/IEAWindSystems/IEA-22-280-RWT) - Repository for the IEA 22-MW offshore reference wind turbine developed by the IEA Wind Task 55 REFWIND
